This folder contains the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that are generated by the chart.
These CRDs are not directly applied to the cluster, as they are not in the chart folder.
CRDs are automatically generated and applied by OASGen Provider.
This folder serves as a reference for the CRDs and is included here for documentation purposes only.
